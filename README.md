# Python_learning
This collection contains my small Python experiments and projects, aimed at practicing programming, mathematics, and computational physics concepts.

## Projects

### 1. Second-Order ODE Solver
- **File:** `second_differential_equation_solver.py`  
- Solves linear second-order differential equations with constant coefficients.  

### 2. Random Values Histogram
- **File:** `random_distribution.py`  
- Generates random numbers, sorts them and visualizes their distribution with a histogram.  

---

## Notes
- These projects use Python along with libraries such as **NumPy**, **Sympy**, and **Matplotlib**.  

---

## Future Plans
- Add more mini-projects on numerical methods, physics simulations, and computational exercises.
